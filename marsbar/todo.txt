Strategy is to use an object to contain MarsBaR / SPM designs
Not quite worked out yet.

remove mars_inputdata_ui, mars_model_data_ui spm2/spm_filter
add cd_images set_images get_images get_image_names in mardo mardo_99 _2

move mars_stat as estimate method to mardo_99, and other files as
private there

set default SPM design type according to current version

work out way of optionally removing xX.V xVi.V xX.W from SPM2
estimated designs, to encourage reestimation.

mars_spm_graph needs fixing for spm2

check images function.
