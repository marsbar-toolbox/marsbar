Citing MarsBaR
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We presented an abstract to the Human Brain Mapping conference for 2002;
this may be useful as a reference: `MarsBaR HBM abstract`_.  It should
apparently be cited as: 

  Matthew Brett, Jean-Luc Anton, Romain Valabregue, Jean-Baptiste
  Poline. Region of interest analysis using an SPM toolbox [abstract]
  Presented at the 8th International Conference on Functional Mapping of
  the Human Brain, June 2-6, 2002, Sendai, Japan. Available on CD-ROM in
  NeuroImage, Vol 16, No 2.

Thanks
