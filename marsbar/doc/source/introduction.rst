What is MarsBaR?
================

MarsBaR (MARSeille Boîte À Région d'Intérêt) is a toolbox for
`SPM`_ which provides routines for region of interest analysis.
Features include region of interest definition, combination of
regions of interest with simple algebra, extraction of data for
regions with and without SPM preprocessing (scaling, filtering), and
statistical analyses of ROI data using the SPM statistics machinery.

We presented an abstract to the Human Brain Mapping conference for 2002;
this may be useful as a reference: `MarsBaR HBM abstract`_.  It should
apparently be cited as:
