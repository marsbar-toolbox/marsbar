===================
 API documentation
===================

The MarsBaR code is reasonably well documented; we export this
documentation as web pages using Guillaume Flandin's excellent
`m2html`_. This is available in the *doc* subdirectory in the main
*marsbar* directory for the devel and stable versions. It is also
available in `the doc-stable/latest`_ directory of the website, for the
stable version, and `the doc-devel/latest`_ for the development version.
