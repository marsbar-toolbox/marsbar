Batch processing scripts for MarsBaR example data
-------------------------------------------------

This directory contains the batch scripts for preprocessing of the
MarsBaR example dataset.  You can get the dataset from the MarsBaR
download page, currently:

https://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=76381

To run initial processing on the dataset in SPM, start matlab, change
('cd') to the '<marsbar>/examples/batch' directory, and, from the
console window run:

run_preprocess

The routines will create smoothed images and run a standard
SPM statistical model on each of the three sessions.

The routines should work with SPM99, SPM2 or SPM5

There is also an example batch script for MarsBaR that replicates the
analyses described in the MarsBaR tutorial; see
http://marsbar.sourceforge.net.  To run:

run_tutorial

Please use the MarsBaR mailing list for any questions or to report
problems:

We wish you a pleasant FMRI experience,

Matthew Brett - for the team
