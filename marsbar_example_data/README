Example dataset for MarsBaR
---------------------------

This dataset contains three EPI runs from a single subject.  See the
following abstract and poster for more details on the design of the
experiment:

http://www.mrc-cbu.cam.ac.uk/Imaging/~matthew.brett/abstracts/ER/er_analysis.html

The dataset is designed to be used with the MarsBaR tutorial, which
should be available via the MarsBaR home page:

http://marsbar.sourceforge.net/

We acquired the three runs (sessions) during a task using visual
events presented with random intervals between events.  In session 1
the average interval between events was 1 second, the average interval
was 3 seconds for session 2 and 10 seconds for session 3.

The dataset contains slice-time corrected realigned undistorted
normalized images, with prefix "nrua", in three data directories,
sess1, sess2 and sess3.  

All the preprocessing scripts are in the main marsbar distribution, in
the 'examples/batch' subdirectory.  To run initial processing on the
dataset in SPM, start matlab, change to the '<marsbar>/examples/batch'
directory, and, from the console window run:

run_preprocess

The routines will create smoothed images and run a standard
SPM statistical model on each of the three sessions.

The routines should work with SPM99, SPM2 or SPM5

There is also an example batch script for MarsBaR that replicates the
analyses described in the MarsBaR tutorial; see
http://marsbar.sourceforge.net.  To run:

run_tutorial

Please use the MarsBaR mailing list for any questions or to report

We wish you a pleasant FMRI experience,

Matthew Brett (for the the team).
